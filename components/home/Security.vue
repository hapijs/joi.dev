          many problems to be solved, not on the details of the tool being used.
          hapi provides the right set of core APIs and extensible plugins to
          support the requirements of a modern service - session management,
          security, connectivity, and testing."

          Along with protecting server load with payload limits and request
          timeouts, hapi blocks error messages that could leak information or
          echo back exploits.
