        hapi comes pretty loaded out-of-the-box, but it also has the most
        <span class="bold">mature and complete</span> set of
        <span class="bold">extension points at every step</span> — including
        <span class="bold">authentication</span>,
        <span class="bold">authorization</span>, and
        <span class="bold">validation</span>.

      Middleware is just another name for bad design.
    </h3>
    <div class="extensibility-context">
      hapi doesn’t use middleware, because it’s a bad pattern. Instead of a
      generic, one-size-fits-all approach taken by almost every other framework,
      hapi provides a rich, laser-focused extensibility model that puts
      <span class="bold">security and predictability first</span>.
    </div>
    <h3 class="home-text-heading">Make it Yours.</h3>
    <div class="extensibility-content">
      hapi has always led the way with tools to make the server yours. It was
      the first to introduce these (often imitated but poorly executed)
      features:
    </div>
    <ul class="extensibility-list">
      <li class="content-list">
        <span class="bold">Framework plugins</span> — a
        <span class="bold">truly composable</span> way of breaking your
        application into logical components with a
        <span class="bold">super-thin abstraction layer</span>.
      </li>
      <li class="content-list">
        <span class="bold">Request lifecycle</span> — the exact order in which
        “stuff happens,” allowing you to choose the specific spot to extend or
        modify how your application operates.
      </li>
      <li class="content-list">
        <span class="bold">Server methods</span> — reusable, cacheable functions
        accessible throughout the application.
      </li>
      <li class="content-list">
        <span class="bold">API Decorations</span> — user-defined API that lives,
        safely, side-by-side the official API.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="extensibility-content">
      Plus, everything is properly namespaced, which makes extensions safe and
      easy to use. You’ll never have to worry about your application failing in
      production because of a runtime conflict between two extensions or
      plugins. Everything is validated in load-time so you can easily identify
      conflicts during development.
